<h1 id="page-level-features-from-the-htrc">Page-Level Features From the HTRC</h1>
<p>We feel that a great deal of useful research can be done with pre-calculated features. We are providing all features in json format. The primary pre-calculated feature that we will be providing is the token (unigram) count, on a per-page basis. In other words, each page will be represented as a collection of pairs where a token is paired with its count on the page. In reality this becomes slightly more complicated because we are also performing part of speech (POS) tagging, and so it is really tokens-as-specific-POS that are being computed.</p>
<p>There is a fair amount of consensus among users that it is important to provide token information at the page level — since it otherwise becomes impossible to separate text from paratext (e.g. thirty pages of publishers’ ads at the back of a book). We have also decided to break each page into a collection of three parts: header, body, and footer.</p>
<p>We use an open-source tool (OpenNLP) for tokenizing text and for tagging parts of speech. This will make it possible for users to reconstruct our process, so they can compare data from HathiTrust volumes to volumes they may have locally. We also rejoin words that are broken across a hyphen at the end of a line.</p>
<p>As part of our page representation, we also include two special features: the number of lines on each page, and the number of lines with text. Finally, we will provide a per-page count of characters that start and end lines on each page (this is a case-sensitive list, created before rejoining words broken at a hyphen). This information can illuminate genre and volume structure: for instance, it helps distinguish poetry from prose, and the text from the body that forms an index.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="token-parse">How are tokens parsed?</h3>
<p>Hyphenation of tokens at end of line were corrected using custom code. <a href="http://opennlp.apache.org/">Apache OpenNLP</a> was used for sentence segmentation, tokenization, and part of speech (POS) tagging. No additional data cleaning or OCR corrections were performed.</p>
<p>OpenNLP uses <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">the Penn Treebank POS tags</a>.</p>
<h3 id="page-id">Can I use the page sequence as an unique identifier?</h3>
<p>The <em>seq</em> value is always sequential from the start. This means that the pages of a volume each have a unique sequence number, but this is specific to the current version of the full text. In theory, updates to the OCR that add or remove pages will change the sequence. The practical likelihood of sequential changes is low, but uses of the page as an id should be cautious.</p>
<p>A future release of this data will include persistent page identifiers that remain unchanged when there are sequential changes.</p>
<h3 id="metadata">Where’s the metadata? Who wrote the book, when is it from, etc.?</h3>
<p>This download only includes <em>features extracted from the full-text pages of volumes</em> in the HTRC collection. For additional metadata information, i.e. author, subject classifications, etc. HT and HTRC offer [a metadata API] where you can find more information about the volumes, using the volume <em>id</em> field.</p>
<h3 id="eol">What do I do with beginning- or end-of-line characters?</h3>
<p>The characters at the start and end of a line can be used to differentiate text from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext">paratext</a> at a page level. For instance, index lines tend to begin with capitalized letters and end with numbers. Likewise, lines in a table of contents can be identified through arabic or roman numerals at the start of a line.</p>
<h3 id="header-q">What is the difference between the header, body, and footer sections?</h3>
<p>Because repeated headers and footers can distort word counts in a document, but also help identify document parts, we attempt to identify repeated lines at the top or bottom of a page and provide separate token counts for those forms of paratext. The “header” and “footer” sections will also include tokens that are page numbers, catchwords, or other short lines at the very top or bottom of a page. Users can of course ignore these divisions by aggregating the token counts for header, body, and footer sections.</p>
<p>The current implementation classifies the part of the page in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a page has &lt; 3 lines, assume no HEADER or FOOTER</li>
<li>for &gt;= 3 lines, assume that there might be a header and a footer… and in that case, the body would be all the lines except the first and last</li>
<li>compute numCharsBody = max(numCharsPerLine) = max number of characters per line for the body where characters are non-whitespace and non-punctuation</li>
<li>compute numCharsHeader and numCharsFooter as the number of characters where characters are non-whitespace and non-punctuation</li>
<li>if the numCharsHeader &lt; numCharsBody * 0.5 then establish the header as the HEADER</li>
<li>if numCharsFooter &lt; numCharsBody * 0.05, then establish the footer as the FOOTER</li>
</ul>
